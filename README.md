# Keyword Extractor React app - OpenAI

## Description
AI-powered frontend React app that will extract the best keywords from any given text. We will be using the completions API from Open AI to generate the keywords.
Basically, this is a simple tool built with React and Chakra UI that uses the Open AI chat completion API to extract the best keywords from any given text.

I have used Vite and react.js as front-end tools in this project and Chakra UI library. It is super easy to use and it's very customizable. If you want to use a different UI library or just use your own CSS, you can do that as well.
